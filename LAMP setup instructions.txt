### LAMP setup and understanding:
# My goal here is not to create a tutorial by which you copy and paste to get things done.
# I want to help you to understand exactly what you are doing and why.

## 0.0 set up a Linux machine or VM
# in this example we will use the CentOS7 distribution of Linux and we will run it on a VM
# open CentOS7 in VMware

## 1.0 install and set up Apache (HTTP server)
sudo yum install httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd.service 			#starts Apache server
sudo systemctl enable httpd.service 		#configures Apache server to launch on startup

## 1.1 install and set up MySQL (your database)
sudo yum install -y mariadb-server
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb

## 1.2 configure MySQL
## NOTE: you should say yes to everything if you don't know exactly what you're doing. You will have to create a non-root account in your MySQL distribution if you want to access phpMyAdmin if you do this.
# --- follow the
sudo mysql_secure_installation
#? sudo mysql
mysql -u root -p #then enter password to get into mariadb to make sure it works. exit

## 1.3 install and enable PHP
sudo yum install -y php php-mysql
sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
vi /var/www/html/info.php # add '<?php ?>' to make the file a php file

## 1.4 install and enable phpMyAdmin (web-based db administration system)
mysql -u [example_user] -p #enter password, make sure it works. exit
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y phpmyadmin
vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf # change the IP addresses from 127.0.0.1 to your computer's IP address (ipv4 from the ipconfig command in the CMD) to allow your computer to access

## 1.5 restart apache & MySQL
sudo systemctl restart httpd
sudo systemctl restart mariadb.service

# now you should be able to log into [your CentOS VM ip]/phpMyAdmin with your mariadb credentials.


### Afterwords:
## a1.0: create an account in your database. This will be necessary if you disallow remote logins for the root user, which is a good idea for security purposes.
# after logging into your MariaDB root user (mysql -u root -p)
CREATE USER [username] IDENTIFIED BY [password];
# you should now be able to log in to phpMyAdmin using your [username] and [password]
